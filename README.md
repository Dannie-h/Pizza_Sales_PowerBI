# Pizza_Sales_PowerBI
 Using Power BI, I created a dashboard that analysed a year's worth of sales data from a fictional pizza joint. The data set included details on each pizza order such as date, time, type, size, and price.

## Insights:

•	Classic Deluxe Pizza is the most popular pizza, but the Thai Chicken Pizza generated the most revenue at $43.43K.

•	We had higher revenue during spring-summer months with a peak in July.

•	Our peak hour is between 12-1 pm, and overall the evening period is the best-selling time of the day.

•	Friday is our most profitable day of the week.

•	Removing XL and XXL sizes from the menu could increase overall revenue as they generated a relatively small percentage of the total revenue.

•	Running promotions during autumn-winter months could increase sales. Happy-hour deals in the evening could increase sales further during this period.
